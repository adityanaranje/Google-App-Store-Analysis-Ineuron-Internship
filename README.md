# Project Title : Google App Store Analysis
# Technologies : Python, Stremlit and Plotly
# Domain : Technology

## Problem Statement:
### -> Technology is the increasing need nowadays and used everywhere. One of the features of Technology is android. Which we all use in our daily life. Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source software, designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.

## Approach
### -> Using classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization, etc.

## Tools Used:
### 1. Python 
### 2. Numpy 
### 3. Pandas
### 4. Plotly
### 5. Matplotlib
### 6. Seaborn 
### 7. Stremlit
### 8. Heroku




## Platforms Used:
### Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, Github, Heroku 




## Operations Performes:
### 1. Data Collection: 
#### -> Data is taken from site given by the organization.
### 2. Data Cleaning:
#### -> Every dataset consists of some missing values and outliers. The categorical missing values are filled with most frequent value i.e. mode while the numeric values are filled with mean. Also the outliers are treated with the mean value correspoiding to their item type. Also removed the duplicate data.
### 3. Data Visualization: 
#### -> Visualizations are performed using libraries like matplotlib, seaborn and plotly by plotting histogram, countplots, scatter plot, etc.
### 4. Data Analysis: 
#### -> Performing data analysis to get valuable insights from the plots.
### 5. Deployment:
#### -> Using Streamlit library the web app is deployed on heroku.
